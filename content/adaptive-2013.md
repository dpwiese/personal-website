description: "This paper presents an adaptive LQR-PI controller applied to a six-degree-of-freedom hypersonic vehicle model. Command tracking and stability are improved over a baseline controller when subject to uncertainties in control effectiveness, center of gravity location, and aerodynamic coefficients."
